# Sparky - Dog Owner Matching App

Sparky is a mobile app designed to help dog owners connect with other dog owners in their local area. It provides a Tinder-like experience where users can match with other dog owners based on their dog's profile and start conversations. The app is built using Flutter for the frontend and an Express backend server to host a MySQL and MongoDB + Mongoose database. The chat feature is implemented using Socket.IO.
